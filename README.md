# admission-management-system
The Student Admission Management System replaces traditional manual processes with a centralized, efficient platform. Students can create personal accounts, update their information, pay admission fees via online methods (e.g., bKash, Rocket), and download admit cards after admin approval. Administrators can manage student accounts, assign faculty, and track updates across departments.

This project was developed as part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering degree at National University, Dhaka during the session 2015â€“2016 .
